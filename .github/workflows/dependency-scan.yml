            ### Frontend (npm)
            - ✅ Snyk scan completed
            - ✅ npm audit completed

            **Note:** Review the artifacts and GitHub Security tab for detailed vulnerability reports.

            ### Next Steps
            1. Review any high/critical vulnerabilities
            2. Update dependencies via Dependabot PRs
            3. Check GitHub Security tab for full report`;
